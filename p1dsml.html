        <p>Bachelor in Science and Technology, completing my second degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of São Paulo. Always focused on learning and becoming an even better data scientist.

            During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a web development project that resulted in publication in the Institute Of Physics magazine. Additionally, I worked for two years as a data scientist intern at Akaer, where I was responsible for creating and managing the database, developing skills such as SQL, VBA, Python and others. Last year, I completed my final work on the topic "Classification of brain tumors using convolutional neural networks and magnetic resonance images" in which I use Machine Learning models to classify these images.
            
            I appreciate a good movie and book. I believe that our personal preferences help us to perceive things more accurately and solve problems.

                    <p>In this work, <b>deep learning models</b> were implemented to classify brain tumors using MRI images.
                        The study focused on evaluating the EfficientNet architecture, along with a simpler model, to compare their performances in terms of accuracy, 
                        precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency. 
                        The dataset used for this analysis contained MRI images classified into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.</p>

                        </figure>
                    <p>The results revealed that the EfficientNet model achieved an accuracy of over 98% across various validation folds,
                        significantly outperforming the simpler model. </p>

                        <p>
                        The performance metrics, including precision and recall, indicated high effectiveness in distinguishing between different tumor types. 
                        The use of advanced visualization techniques such as heatmaps and Grad-CAM provided valuable insights into which regions of the 
                        MRI images were most influential in the model's decision-making process.</p>
                        
                        <figure class="image-container">

                        </figure>
                    <p>However, it was noted that the EfficientNet model required significantly more computational resources and training time compared to the simpler model. 
                        Despite this, the trade-off between computational cost and performance was deemed justified, especially given 
                        the critical nature of medical image classification. The study emphasized that the cross-validation technique, 
                        while increasing training time by approximately 400%, was essential for ensuring robust model performance across the dataset</p>
