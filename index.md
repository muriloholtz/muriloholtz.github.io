### Classification of brain tumors using convolutional neural networks and magnetic resonance imaging
In this work, the objective is to employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for brain tumor detection from different data sets. In addition to the implementation, the algorithms will be validated based on metrics that direct us to choose the best model.

### Development of classification algorithms with Iris Species dataset
The best way to know which classification algorithm works better is by testing them. In this work, Iris dataset were separated in groups for training and testing. Also, algorithms such as KNN (K Nearest Neighbours), Naive Bayes, Hunt were developed from scratch [1]. Then, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and (MLP) Multi-layer Perceptron  were developed using sklearn [2].
The dataset used includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
