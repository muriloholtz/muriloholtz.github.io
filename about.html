        <p>Bachelor in Science and Technology, completing my second degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of São Paulo. Always focused on learning and becoming an even better data scientist.

            During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a web development project that resulted in publication in the Institute Of Physics magazine. Additionally, I worked for two years as a data scientist intern at Akaer, where I was responsible for creating and managing the database, developing skills such as SQL, VBA, Python and others. Last year, I completed my final work on the topic "Classification of brain tumors using convolutional neural networks and magnetic resonance images" in which I use Machine Learning models to classify these images.
            
            I appreciate a good movie and book. I believe that our personal preferences help us to perceive things more accurately and solve problems.
